## Overview

This project contains solutions to various JavaScript programming questions covering concepts such as:
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- DOM manipulation
- Control structures
- Pattern printing
- User input handling
- Basic algorithms (sorting, searching, prime checking)

These assignments were completed as part of the Saylani Mass IT Training program's Techno Kids Batch 7 curriculum to demonstrate understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by chapters and then by individual questions:

```
Assignment-4/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── QWEN.md
├── .git/
└── chapter-18-to-20/
    ├── question-01/
    ├── question-02/
    ├── ...
    ├── question-20/
    └── README.md
```

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html` - HTML file to run the solution
- `script.js` - JavaScript implementation of the solution

## Questions

The project is organized into multiple questions covering different JavaScript concepts:

- **Question 1-19**: Individual JavaScript problems covering various concepts like arrays, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation
- **Question 20**: Contains three parts (A, B, C) focusing on pattern printing:
  - Part A: Print 4 rows of 5 stars each
  - Part B: Print ascending star pattern (1 to 5 stars)
  - Part C: Print descending star pattern (5 to 1 stars)

Each question is contained in its respective directory with HTML and JavaScript files.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git for version control

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. You can run the files directly in your browser.

## Usage

To run any specific question:
1. Navigate to the question's directory (e.g., `chapter-18-to-20/question-01/`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code will execute as specified in the assignment requirements

For local development, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, the following JavaScript concepts were practiced:
- Array manipulation and searching
- Loop structures (for, while)
- Conditional statements
- DOM manipulation
- Pattern printing with JavaScript
- Basic HTML and JavaScript integration
- User input handling
- Algorithm implementation (sorting, searching)
